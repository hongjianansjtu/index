\subsubsection{Completeness}
We first prove the completeness of the procedure: if the user is honest, and holds an attribute-based anonymous credential $\sigma=(A, x, s)$, then it is able to pass the authentication if it correctly executes all the required steps.
%\begin{list}{}{}
 %   \item{\bullet}If the user is honest, and possesses a credential $\sigma$ 
%\end{list}
